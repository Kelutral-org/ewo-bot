Game
```
Wordgame is a basic word-based game designed to enhance a student's vocabulary, speed, and understanding of the sound system.
The exact goal of the game depends on the gamemode, but the basic principle is universal: Say a word that **begins** with *the same letter* that the previous word **ends** with.
For example:
``plltxe``
``eltu``
``utral``
etc.

```
Playmodes
```
Wordgame has two playmodes: Solo and Multiplayer.
**Solo:**
    ・The bot will automatically respond.
    ・Only the player who started the game can play.
    ・Points cannot be earned.

**Multiplayer:**
    ・The bot will *not* respond.
    ・More than one player *is required*.
    ・Points can be earned.

Gamemodes
```
Wordgame has 3 gamemodes: Casual, Competitive, and Deathmatch.
**Casual:**
    ・Words can be reused, just not too frequently (five other words must be used in order for a word to be reused).
    ・The game will not end until manually stopped.
    ・Points are awarded to everyone, and no bonuses are given.

**Competitive**:
    ・Words *cannot* be reused.
    ・The first player to say a word that leaves no more options for other players wins.
    ・Points are still awarded to everyone, but the winner is given a bonus.

**Deathmatch**:
    ・You must join the game when it starts.
    ・If a player says a word that has already been used, they are eliminated.
    ・The last player left wins.
    ・Points are still awarded to everyone, but the winner is given a bonus.
    ・Forces multiplayer.
